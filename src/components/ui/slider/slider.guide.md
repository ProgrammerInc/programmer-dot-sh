# Slider Component Guide

## Overview

The Slider component is a versatile input control that allows users to select a value or range from a set of values. It's built using the Radix UI Slider primitive, providing robust accessibility and keyboard navigation support.

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Keyboard Navigation

The Slider component supports the following keyboard interactions:

- **Arrow Left/Down**: Decrease the value by one step
- **Arrow Right/Up**: Increase the value by one step
- **Page Down**: Decrease the value by a larger step
- **Page Up**: Increase the value by a larger step
- **Home**: Set to minimum value
- **End**: Set to maximum value

### ARIA Attributes

For proper screen reader support, always include an `aria-label` or ensure the slider has a visible label with a proper `id` association:

```tsx
// Using aria-label
<Slider aria-label="Volume" defaultValue={[50]} />

// Using aria-labelledby
<label id="volume-label">Volume</label>
<Slider aria-labelledby="volume-label" defaultValue={[50]} />
```

### Color Contrast

Ensure that:

1. The track and thumb have sufficient color contrast against the background
2. The range has sufficient color contrast against the track
3. Focus states are clearly visible

## Best Practices

### Provide Visual Feedback

- Add a tooltip or label that shows the current value when the user interacts with the slider
- Consider adding tick marks for important values

### Step Size

- Use an appropriate step size for the data type
- For precise control, use smaller step values
- For quick selection, use larger step values

### Default Values

- Set sensible default values that match common user needs
- Consider the context when setting default values

### Form Integration

- Always include the slider in a form when collecting user input
- Provide a way to reset the slider to its default value
- Handle form submission with the current slider value

### Visual Design

- Use consistent colors and styling across your application
- Make the interactive elements (thumb) large enough for touch interaction
- Consider the needs of users with motor disabilities

## Usage Examples

See the `slider.examples.md` file for comprehensive usage examples.

## Implementation Notes

### CSS Customization

The Slider component uses CSS modules with the following class names:

- `slider-root`: The main container
- `slider-track`: The track that contains the range
- `slider-range`: The filled part of the track
- `slider-thumb`: The draggable thumb

You can override these styles by passing a `className` prop to the respective component.

### Performance Considerations

- The component uses `React.memo` for optimal rendering performance
- For controlled components, use the `onValueCommit` event for expensive operations rather than `onValueChange` to avoid performance issues during dragging
